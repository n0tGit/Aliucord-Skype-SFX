# Aliucord-Skype-SFX
Skype-styled SFX for Android Aliucord themes.

### Looking for the Desktop BetterDiscord version? Go [here](https://github.com/n0tGit/BD-Skype-SFX/).

These guides will assume the following:
- You have [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) installed.
- You have the [Themer](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/tree/main/Themer) plugin installed.
- (**Recommended**) You have the [DedicatedPluginSettings](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/tree/main/DedicatedPluginSettings) plugin installed.

## "Automatic" method:
This is not automatic per-se, but it saves you the need for copying and pasting each link.
1. Download the JSON file [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/n0tGit/Aliucord-Skype-SFX/raw/main/SkypeSoundTheme.json). Alternatively, you can check the raw file [here](https://github.com/n0tGit/Aliucord-Skype-SFX/raw/main/SkypeSoundTheme.json) - I created this link using [Minhas Kamal](https://github.com/MinhasKamal)'s [DownGit](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/DownGit) website.
2. Go to your Downloads folder.
3. Move SkypeSoundTheme.json to /sdcard/Aliucord/Themes.
4. Open Aliucord.
5. Open your channel tab.

   - i. Go to Plugins.
   - ii. Search "Themer".
   - iii. Tap "Settings".
   - iv. Tap "Enable Custom Sounds". **If it's already enabled, skip this.** Aliucord may ask you if you want to restart. **Don't do it yet**.
   - v. Enable n0tEll10T's Skype Sound Theme.
   - vi. Aliucord will ask you if you want to restart. Tap "RESTART", or swipe away Aliucord and reopen it.
